    <!-- An array of triplets made of (camera ID, qualities, framerates).
         These video modes will be added to the available
         quality/framerate combinations of a camera device.
         Make sure the device is able to handle those configurations
         and maintain a stable framerate at any condition.
         Note that you can't add video qualities that aren't
         exposed by the camera, only new framerates.
         Valid values of resolution are:
          - "sd" (480p)
          - "hd" (720p)
          - "fhd" (1080p)
          - "uhd" (2160p)
         Valid values of framerate are:
          - "24"
          - "30"
          - "60"
          - "120"

         These values will be added to the lens selector if one or more cameras uses the
         multi-camera API to let the user select which lens to use.
         It's highly recommended to leave config_enableAuxCameras to false, since with
         multi-camera API you only use a single camera device for all sensors.
         You may enable it if you need auxiliary camera devices for a set of cameras on one
         of the device's side (e.g. logical main back camera but multiple physical camera
         devices on front), in that case if a main device side's lens is referenced here
         all the auxiliary camera devices of that side will be ignored.
         You may be able to get the exact zoom ratio needed to trigger the lens switch from
         your stock camera app and observing the zoom ratio it sets with the following command:
         adb shell dumpsys media.camera | grep 'android.control.zoomRatio' -1
         Example for Google Pixel 7 Pro's back camera configuration:

                 <item>0</item> <item>0.5</item> <item>0.55632502</item>
