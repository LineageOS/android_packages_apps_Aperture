    <!-- An array of triplets made of (camera ID, qualities, framerate).
         These video modes will be added to the available
         quality/framerate combinations of a camera device.
         Make sure the device is able to handle those configurations
         and maintain a stable framerate at any condition.
         Note that you can't add video qualities that aren't
         exposed by the camera, only new framerates.
         Valid values of resolution are:
          - "sd" (480p)
