      "message": "I think this is causing an issue, but if someone could confirm this, it would be great.\nBasically, if you update a ROM that had Camera2 (AOSP) installed, and you now include Aperture, Aperture will still use the camera 2 package name. \nHowever, rro overlays are meant to be for Aperture:\n\ncheeseburger:/ # pm list packages|grep -i camera2\npackage:com.android.camera2\ncheeseburger:/ # pm list packages|grep -i aperture\npackage:org.lineageos.aperture.auto_generated_rro_vendor\n\nIf I open \u0027Camera\u0027 from the Launcher, Aperture starts but in the logs it is reported as camera2:\nActivityTaskManager: START u0 {act\u003dandroid.intent.action.MAIN cat\u003d[android.intent.category.LAUNCHER] flg\u003d0x10200000 cmp\u003dcom.android.camera2/com.android.camera.CameraLauncher bnds\u003d[282,1316][540,1700]} from uid 10304\n\n\nIs this caused by this commit?",
